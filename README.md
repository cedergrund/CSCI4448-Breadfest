**Project Description:**

* In the land of Rawr-dough Valley, one commodity is valued above all others: Bread! The foundational creation (and the valley’s #1 export!) comes in all forms, shapes, sizes... and magical ingredients. In fact, the valley lies on a hotbed of dark cave systems in which destructive dinosaurs lurk, protecting edible nuggets of bread supplementation. The variety in taste & utility of these nuggets brings bread innovation to a scale not seen anywhere outside the valley’s high mountains. And, at the culmination of this innovation lies Breadfest: the most renowned exhibition festival of Rawr-dough Valley’s master bread bakers!
* In ‘The Quest for Breadfest,’ you play as a baker hopeful - cyclically gathering ingredients from the valley’s caves and using them to bake an original bread - hoping one day to bake a bread worthy enough to join the elite class of master bread bakers that get to present their creations at Breadfest. With each bake, your cave collection skills grow, and your name earns glory. Will you make it out of the caves, or will they be your doom? Can you bake a worthy bread, or should you have become a healer or law-speaker like your parents wanted? Do you have what it takes to be a master baker? Find out in The Quest for Breadfest!
